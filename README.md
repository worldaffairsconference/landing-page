# landing-page
The landing page for WAC, which functions as a coming-soon page.

As a note, my final goal is to use a version of [liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight) instead of Bootstrap since we don't need the vast majority of it's bloat. The current template is here just to get a feel of things.

```
sass --watch css
```
